## Experimental design

The simulated dataset used in this study consists of 1,000 genes across 48 samples. The dataset is designed to be computationally efficient, with confirmed scalability to larger real-life datasets.

An HTML with the steps for creating the data is available [here](https://julienroyulaval.github.io/DESeq2-MultiBatch/docs/JR_data_creation_html_08-09-2025.html), which can be found in the docs folder. It can be used to change the experimental design and factors.

The experimental design involves two batches, modeling gene expression in dioecious plants (e.g., XX/XY system) undergoing sex-specific treatments at two distinct time points: Day 0 (vegetative) and Day 1 (early flowering). Due to sex-specific treatments to alter flower sex, male and female plants were separated across batches:

Batch A: Female controls (n=6) and treated males (n=6)

Batch B: Male controls (n=6) and treated females (n=6)

The treatments were applied following Day 0 measurements but before Day 1 measurements, allowing Day 0 data to serve as a baseline for controlling batch effects. Samples were collected across two genotypes, with three biological replicates per combination of sex, treatment, genotype, and time point.

# Single and double batch correction

## Load data

```
# load metadata
coldata <- read.csv(file = "coldata.csv")
coldata[,2:6] <- lapply(coldata[,2:6], as.factor)

# load counts
counts <- read.csv(file = "counts.csv", row.names = 1)
```
Samples are rows in the ColData, with factors as columns. In the count file, rows are genes with samples as columns.

## Run DESeq2

Here, we prepare dds objects and run the analysis

### Single batch design

The first object does not include an interaction factor.

```
library(DESeq2)

design_single <- ~ Day + Batch + Genotype + Sex + Sex:Day + Treatment

dds_single <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts, colData = coldata, design = design_single)

dds_single <- DESeq(dds_single)
```

### Double batch design (interaction with sex)

```
design_double <- ~ Day + Batch + Genotype + Sex + Sex:Batch + Sex:Day + Treatment

dds_double <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts, colData = coldata, design = design_double)

dds_double <- DESeq(dds_double)
```

## MultiBatch function

**MultiBatch**

Adjust normalized RNA-seq counts by removing batch effects estimated by a DESeq2 model, optionally including a Batch×Interaction term. Works with ≥2 batch levels and ≥2 interaction levels.


**Description**

MultiBatch() builds per-gene scaling factors from DESeq2 coefficients and applies them to the count matrix. Two adjustment modes are available:

"center" (default): centers batch effects within each interaction level to the geometric mean across batch levels.

"reference": maps all batches back to the reference batch level used by DESeq2.

If an interaction factor is provided, the function combines the main Batch effects with Batch × Interaction effects for the appropriate interaction level of each sample.


**Arguments**

dds: A DESeqDataSet fit with DESeq(). Its design must include the batch factor (and, if used, the interaction term with interact_factor).

batch_factor: column name in colData(dds) giving the batch factor (e.g., "Batch"). Must have ≥2 levels. The first level in levels(colData(dds)[[batch_factor]]) is treated as the reference.

interact_factor: if provided, must be a column in colData(dds) used in the model such that the design includes the interaction with batch. Any number of levels is supported; the first is the reference interaction level.

mode: "center" or "reference". "center" subtracts the per-gene mean batch effect (within each interaction level), then rescales counts by 2^(-centered_effect). "reference" rescales counts by 2^(-effect) so all batches map to the reference batch.

use_normalized: Logical. If TRUE (default), adjusts counts(dds, normalized = TRUE). If FALSE, adjusts raw counts (rarely desired).

round_out: Logical. If TRUE (default), rounds the adjusted matrix to integers.

independentFiltering: Logical passed to DESeq2::results() when extracting coefficients; defaults to FALSE to avoid NA filtering of LFCs.

verbose: Logical. If TRUE, prints progress and notes about detected coefficients and reference levels.


**Value**

A list with components:

adjusted_counts: matrix of adjusted counts (integer if round_out = TRUE), same dim/rownames/colnames as the input counts.

scaling_tables: list of matrices (one per interaction level) of per-gene scaling factors, columns ordered by batch levels.

delta_tables: list of matrices (one per interaction level) of per-gene log2 effects before conversion to scaling factors.

batch_levels: character vector of batch levels (reference is first).

interact_levels: character vector of interaction levels (or "(no-int)" if interact_factor = NULL).

reference: list(batch = <ref_batch>, interact = <ref_interact>).

mode: the adjustment mode used.

used_results_names: the resultsNames(dds) captured for reproducibility/debugging


**Notes**

The function does not alter other factors beyond removing/centering the Batch (and optionally Batch×Interaction) contributions from the counts matrix used for visualization/PCA/heatmaps. Use the original dds for inference (contrasts, p-values).

## Apply corrections

# single

adj_s <- MultiBatch(
  dds_single,
  batch_factor    = "Batch",
  interact_factor = NULL,
  mode = "center",
  use_normalized = TRUE,
  round_out = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE)

scaled_counts_single <- adj_s$adjusted_counts

# double
adj_d <- MultiBatch(

scaled_counts_double <- adj_d$adjusted_counts
```
Scaled counts are not meant to be reused for differential expression analysis with DESeq2 or other tools.

While the contrasts obtained by using DESeq2 on the scaled counts with a design that excludes the *batch* factor will provide the same log2 fold changes as the original DESeq2 analysis, the *p* values and the adjusted *p* values will be skewed, leading to an increase in false positives.
